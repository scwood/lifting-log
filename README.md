# Lifting log üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Lifting log is a web app to track resistance training workouts.

https://scwood.github.io/lifting-log

## Features

- Define your weekly workout plan once, get weekly workouts auto generated as you progress
- Create per-exercise warm-up schemes
- If your exercise uses plates (bench press, weighted pull-ups etc.) the app will tell you what plates to put on the bar, even for warmup sets
- Easy progressive overload: once you've completed an exercise during a session, the app will ask you if you want to add a rep, weight, or keep things the same for next session
- Add, remove, or change specific exercises in your plan as your workouts evolve
- Supports symetrical and asymetrical weekly plans 
- Google and GitHub login supported currently, would like to add Apple in the future
